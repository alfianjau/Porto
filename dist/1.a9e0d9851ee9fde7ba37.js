The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: <a href=\"http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf\">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></p>\n<p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:\nUsers can visit our site anonymously.\nOnce this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.\nOur Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>\n<p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:\n• On our Privacy Policy Page\nCan change your personal information:\n• By emailing us</p>\n<h3>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h3>\n<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>\n<h3>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h3>\n<p>It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>\n<h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>\n<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
